I've been following "Xor" ([@XorDev](https://x.com/XorDev)) on X for quite a long time. He always posts mesmerizing shaders. I think they are really cool. Now that I have some free time, I want to start learning about shaders too.

I found this *"book"* called "[The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com)" by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe. It's for learning about fragment shaders from the very basic concepts. 

This is a great place to start for me.
