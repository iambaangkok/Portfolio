# 1st Playtest

Some pictures from our first playtest of #FLATLINEBoardGame with my friends! 

It was great fun and we received a great amount of feedback too.

* There are still problems with the enemy phase: the players them selves need to play as the enemies too, and the rules for the enemy is pretty complex
  * → just add another play that is the "DM" who plays the enemies
* The cards has many details left-out because they are hand drawn, this makes the players need to go to the Rulebook to read the actual item description.
  * → Make better cards
