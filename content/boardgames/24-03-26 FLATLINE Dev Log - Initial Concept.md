# Beginning

During the summer of 2024, a boardgame-loving friend and I decided that we wanted to create a boardgame of our own. We initially came across the idea of "Turn-based Strategy Tactical-Shooter Gun-Smith Cyberpunk Co-op Dungeon-Crawler" (basically combines the things we like.)

We discussed a lot on concepts like:

* Weapon customization
* Weapon stats:
  * Bullet caliber
  * Firerate
  * Magazine size
  * Effective range
  * etc.
* Moving: Grid-based VS Free-move
* Items & Gadgets
* Health & Health-tracking
* Body Armor
* An "Overwatch" concept where units can choose to hold an angle, and if an enemy walks into line-of-sight, the unit will get to shoot first.
* The Shop - to buy weapons, weapon parts, items, and gadgets
* Campaigns

and many more! there are so much to think of when making boardgames!
