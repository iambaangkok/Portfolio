There were many issues, we noted them down so we can fix them for the next play test. Examples are balance issues, the pain of having to move the countless enemies, etc.

The other thing is that none of our friends has Tabletop Simulator (it's a Steam app that users can make their own boardgames). So we need to make a real-life prototype.

# Assets
