![COOLANT BANNER](</image/my-games/Coolant!/COOLANT BANNER.png>)

The Reactor is heating up and it will explode!! … unless you cool it down with something … maybe a **Coolant!**

**Coolants** are dropped around the map and you must take them to **the** **Reactor** .

But that is not so easy because when the Coolant spawns, some **inter-dimensional lava slimes** also spawns. They want the coolant to cool their melting body!
