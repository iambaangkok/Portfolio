There will be no more updates and patches to this project as the Unity project files are lost because they were not migrated during Unity's 2022 SCM migration period.

### NSC 2019
SoN was developed by 3 people: Me, Phurin, and Phatadon. It is our submission in the National Software Contest 2019 (NSC 2019). Placing 4th in the final round, we got the honorable mention award.

#### Quest System
There are main quests and side quests. You can track a quest and it will appear on the minimap. Completing quests gives exps, skill points, and unlocks new parts of the world.

#### Achievement
There are multiple achievements in this game, they are milestones that tell how much you've done in the game.

#### Terrain, Navigation, Culling
The world map was made as one large mesh file, this is used for NavMesh generation which would handle the characters moving around. Then the terrain was divided into smaller chunks to optimize rendering, only render the chunks that are visible by the player / around the player. 

## Controls

* Mouse & Keyboard
* I recommend playing through the tutorial
  * The tutorial is a little bugged with the skilltree ui appearing. You have to left-click + drag it to somewhere outside of your view.
